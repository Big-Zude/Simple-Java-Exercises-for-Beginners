# Task Descriptions
In this file you get the requirements you have to accomplish for each tasks. Hope you have fun solving them!

### Task1
+ Output any string mirrored

### Task 2
+ Display all numbers from 1 to 100 that can be divided by 9 or 6 with a "+".

### Task 3 
+ Output several squares (number according to a variable) in an output window, where a certain distance from the edge is given and the squares must also have the same distance from each other.
+ Example n = 4

### Task 4
+ Replace all the characters with '#' that aren't 's'. This should also work with other characters. So please use a variable 
+ Example: "a1defcaad" -> "#1defc##d"

### Task 5
+ TBA

### Task 6
+  Display the following pattern with StdDraw. Please use a for loop.

### Task 7
+ Format a binary number (given as a String) into groups of 4 digits.
+ Example: 11010110101101001 -> 1 1010 1101 0110 1001

### Task 8
+ Draw on a 500x500 canvas square with the color changing from one corner to the other. At the bottom left the square is black and towards the top right the squares become lighter and lighter.

### Task 9 
+ Read a string containing letters and numbers 2, 3 and 4 (e.g. H3ello W4orld). The number in front of the character indicates how often the following character is repeated (H3ello = Heeello).

### Task 10
+ Draw a number of circles. The outermost circle must be grey and the further inside the darker the circle becomes.

### Task 11 - 26 
+ TBA

### Task 27
+ The string "dies ist der erste String in diesem Programm" is given. After each occurrence of a certain character, it should be capitalized how often it occurs!  Maximum it should come up to THREE. That means with the string mentioned above "diEINSes ist dZWEIer DREIerste String in diesem Programm" should come out.

### Task 28
+ Draw a pyramid with n steps. The steps should go up to one side and go down again from the middle.
![Example for Task 28 ](taskdescriptionimages/Task28.png "Example for Task 28")

## Task 29 
+ You read out a string and output it backwards. After that you output the sum of all characters afterwards
+ Example:  Parken => nekraP, 609

### Task 30 
+ Draw n * n circles. In the diagonal the circles should be separated. That means one side should be green and the other side should be blue. The window should be with a fixed width of 400 pixels. The size of the circles should be propertional to the number.

Example n = 5
